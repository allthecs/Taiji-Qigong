<h1 align="center">allthecs: Taiji Qigong</h1>
<h1 class="style5">Based on, Professor Lin Houshengs&rsquo; Taiji Qigong Shibashi for health and wellbeing (1979-1984)</h1>
<h1 class="style5">What is Taiji Qigong?</h1>
<p class="style5" dir="ltr">&ldquo;Tai Chi&rdquo; or &quot;Taiji&quot; means &ldquo;Supreme Ultimate,&rdquo; representing the &ldquo;Cosmos&rdquo; principles of yin and yang. Taiji is rooted in Qigong the Chinese practice of cultivating &lsquo;Qi&rsquo; (Vital Energy)&nbsp;by aligning breath, movement, and awareness for healing.</p>
<p class="style5" dir="ltr">Taiji  (in all  forms&nbsp;and spellings) can be traced back hundreds of years.&nbsp;Qigong in its&rsquo; many guises, can be traced&nbsp;back seven&nbsp;thousand&nbsp;years.&nbsp;That said, Chairman Mao Zedongs' Cultural Revolution (1949-1976), banned all forms of Taiji.&nbsp; Under his regime anyone discovered practising Taiji put themselves and their family at risked of public ridicule and imprisonment.</p>
<p class="style5" dir="ltr">Post&nbsp;Mao Zedong:</p>
<p class="style5" dir="ltr">Today there are countless forms of Taiji Qigong (&amp; Taiji ch'&uuml;an) taught around the world. Professor Lin Houshengs&rsquo; Taiji Qigong Shibashi is arguably the most widely taught/practiced Taiji Qigong  for health and wellbeing by older peole world wide.</p>
<p class="style5" dir="ltr"> Taiji ch'&uuml;an (Taijiquan/shadow boxing) is also practiced world wide having been developed and popularised by Professor&nbsp;Cheng Man Ch&rsquo;ing&nbsp;(1902-1975). Taiji Qigong &amp; Taiji ch'&uuml;an share many characteristics and often taught together  Taiji ch'&uuml;an is however primarily martial in practice.<br />
  <br />
  Other forms of Taiji worth a mention include:&nbsp;Yang, Hao, Wu, Chen, and Sun. Regardless of origin/school all Tai Chi share at least one of four core elements: &lsquo;Martial&rsquo;, Spiritual, Physical and Mental (Wellbeing).</p>
<p class="style6" dir="ltr">Professor Lin Housheng's Taiji Qigong Shibashi is based on the philosophy and principles of Qigong having choreographed movements and postures, Qigong breathing and modified &lsquo;Yang Style&rsquo; Tai Chi.</p>
<p class="style5" dir="ltr">&nbsp;<br />
   Chines&nbsp; whispers:</p>
<p class="style5" dir="ltr">When searching the internet for Taiji Qigong tutorials, the first thing to jump out is the myriad&nbsp;&nbsp;of different 'schools' of Taiji Qigong practice. Most use the same set of  moves developed by Professor Lin Housheng, but with different 'interpretations' of the original chorography with the possible exception to the wiji, bow and horse stances.</p>
<p class="style5" dir="ltr">Doing it the  wrong way!</p>
<p class="style5" dir="ltr">Except for one small caveat,&nbsp;there is no right or wrong way to practice Taiji Qigong Shibashi. The caveat being, if you find any move uncomfortable or stressful either a) moderate it, or b) avoid it.</p>
<p class="style5" dir="ltr">When practiced the right way you will be able to effortlessly merge  even-paced movements with  rhythmic breathing.&nbsp; You will also be aware of the sensations arising from the 'life energy' streaming throughout the body as you practice.</p>
<p class="style5" dir="ltr">Benefits</p>
<p class="style5" dir="ltr">Taiji Qigong Shibashi isn't just  good for your health and wellbeing, it has the advantage of being able to be practiced by anyone anywhere at anytime. At home on your own or with friends, in a large group on the beach or a park.&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t even require specialist equipment or levels of ability or fitness. (Although, relaxing meditative or traditional Taiji Qigong music, is helpful) . So the only barrier to practising Taiji Qigong is the excuse  you make for not having a go! </p>
<p class="style5" dir="ltr">The many  health benefits of regular Taiji Qigong are recognised and encouraged by western health services including the NHS.</p>
<p class="style5">&nbsp;</p>
<h1 class="style5" id="h.svtqfdye380w" dir="ltr">Past Masters</h1>
<p class="style5" dir="ltr">As an unfit over weight old codger with an interest in Taiji Qigong and&nbsp;Taiji ch'&uuml;an I've spent years&nbsp;looking for that easy to follow no commitment Taiji Qigong site for health and wellbeing.</p>
<span class="style5">It turns out there are hundreds of Taiji Qigong and Taiji ch'&uuml;an&nbsp;organisations out there offering wisdom and instruction.&nbsp; Some charge for online membership with paid tutorials. Others have a mix of&nbsp;free&nbsp;with&nbsp;fee&nbsp;tutorials.&nbsp; Some dress up in traditional/historic costume to add authenticity and as homage to the past. Whilst others demonstrate for free in the local park in a 'just get on with it' fashion.&nbsp;</span>
<p class="style5" dir="ltr">In attempting to master a form of Taiji Qigong&nbsp; right for me, the following Masters, Tutors and Mentors have been invaluable and worth checking out!</p>

<h1 class="style5" id="h.yz76ow67v4vb" dir="ltr">&nbsp;</h1>
<h1 class="style5" dir="ltr">The Five  Elements</h1>
<p class="style5" dir="ltr">The&nbsp;5  &nbsp;Element&nbsp;are&nbsp;an ancient understanding of the natural world&nbsp;expressed through the movement and transformation of&nbsp;the&nbsp;environment (Qi). The elements&nbsp;are&nbsp;interrelated and influence&nbsp;each other.&nbsp; All life including Humans are an integral part of the&nbsp;system. The elements&nbsp;together with Yin and Yang, are the main methods used in Traditional Chinese Medicine to help&nbsp;inform&nbsp;our connection to and relationship with our environment and the universe. The elements traditional are: Metal, Water, Wood, Fire and Earth.</p>
<p class="style5" dir="ltr">Metal.<br />
&nbsp;Associated with the lungs, colour white, sound &lsquo;SSSS&rsquo; and the autumn.</p>
<p class="style5" dir="ltr">Water.<br />
  Associated with the kidneys, colour: blue, sound &lsquo;CHOOO&rsquo; and the winter.</p>
<p class="style5" dir="ltr">Wood.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;	&nbsp;Associated with the liver, colour: green, sound &lsquo;SHHH&rsquo; and the spring.</p>
<p class="style5" dir="ltr">Fire.<br />
  Associated with the heart colour: red, sound &lsquo;HAAHHHH&rsquo;&nbsp; and the summer.</p>
<p class="style5" dir="ltr">Earth.<br />
  Associated with the spleen, colour: yellow, sound: WHOOOO and late summer.</p>
<span class="style5"><br />
</span>
<p class="style5" dir="ltr">However, there are hundreds of interpretations&nbsp;or expressions (no exaggeration) of the 5 elements. Some&nbsp;(in my opinion) are perhaps a bit &lsquo;made-de-up-pee&rsquo; lacking any direct cultural or historical link.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style5" dir="ltr">There are also 5 animal elements to consider that can be traced back for more than 2 millennia i.e.&nbsp;tiger, deer, bear, monkey and crane.&nbsp;&nbsp;Often couple with the animal elements are 'animal' martial art forms to numerous to cover here:</p>
<p class="style5" dir="ltr">See&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_styles_in_Chinese_martial_arts#:~:text=The%20five%20animals%20in%20the,organs%20%28Zang%2FFu%29." target="_blank">Animal styles in Chinese martial arts</a></p>
<span class="style5"><br />
</span>
<p class="style5" dir="ltr">Some regular examples of element interpretation include: </p>
<p class="style5" dir="ltr">Mimi Kuo-Deemer<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6Y8QSVyYhM" target="_blank">&nbsp;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6Y8QSVyYhM</a>&nbsp;interpretation of the elements requiring a flexibility I can only dream of.</p>
<p class="style5" dir="ltr">Franziska R&uuml;scher interpretation<a href="https://taiji-forum.com/qigong-chi-kung/5-elements-qigong/" target="_blank">&nbsp;https://taiji-forum.com/qigong-chi-kung/5-elements-qigong/</a>&nbsp;on the other hand is much friendlier for the beginner.</p>
<p class="style5" dir="ltr">Nick Loffree interpretation<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4so3vdKv2VU" target="_blank">&nbsp;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4so3vdKv2VU</a>&nbsp;is a good example of &lsquo;alternative style&rsquo;. The question here is &lsquo;what do I want from it&rsquo;? i.e Martial, Spiritual, Health/Wellbeing or combination.</p>
<p class="style5" dir="ltr">Wu Xing Qigong interpretation<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdmH4oXzU0g" target="_blank">&nbsp;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdmH4oXzU0g</a>&nbsp;is different again.&nbsp; For all the hand movements this version is particularly hard on the legs.</p>
<p class="style5" dir="ltr">Dr Khanita Suvarnasuddhi on the other hand is a specialist in holistic pain management and her interpretation<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdmH4oXzU0g" target="_blank">&nbsp;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTuJz5uYHMk&amp;t=1s</a>&nbsp;of the 5 elements is based on her work as a pain specialist.&nbsp; Plus it&rsquo;s easy to learn and practice.</p>
<p class="style5" dir="ltr">Perhaps, one of the significant benefits of regular Qigong Taiji is the management of chronic pain.&nbsp; Many of the movements and exercises recommended by NHS physiotherapists can be found in Taiji form (or should that be the other way around?).&nbsp; If you are taking up Taiji Qigong as a means of managing chronic pain this site might be of interest to you.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBb7tMnxgd7QqOS54rcU_uA" target="_blank">&nbsp;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBb7tMnxgd7QqOS54rcU_uA</a>&nbsp;. However, it's always good idea to check with your G.P. first to make sure it's right for you. </p>
<p class="style5" dir="ltr">Qigong Meditation<br />
  Five Elements according to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.simonblowqigong.com/qigong-meditation-return-to-nothingness/" target="_blank">Simon Blow</a></p>
<p class="style5" dir="ltr">[Simons&rsquo;] meditation focuses on the five solid (Yin) organs of the body and their corresponding element:-&nbsp; Heart (Fire), Spleen (Earth), Lungs (Metal), Kidneys (Water) and Liver (Wood). According to Simon Blow these organs function a bit like batteries and when we bring our awareness and energy to them, they help our Qi flow smoothly and bring harmony to mind, body and spirit. The Qi from these organs then supplies the flowing (Yang) organs : Small Intestine (Fire), Stomach (Earth), Large Intestine (Metal), Urinary Bladder (Water) and Gall Bladder (Wood).&rdquo;</p>
<span class="style5"><br />
</span>
<p class="style5" dir="ltr">Simon Blow has a serious back catalogue&nbsp;&nbsp;of work on meditation and Taiji qigong and is one of many authors&nbsp;&nbsp;to publish on this subject.</p>
<p class="style5" dir="ltr">Note:&nbsp;Element order changes depending on school of thought/academy.&nbsp; Simon Blow suggests starting with Fire or Heart whilst others start with Metal or Lungs and others wood or liver.</p>
